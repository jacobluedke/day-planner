  ## Description
  This application allows the user to write and save notes for specific times during usual work day hours.
  It compares the listed hour slots to the current hour to color the text areas based on if they have already passed, has yet to happen, or if it is currently that time. When the user clicks the save button next to the text area, the text for that hour is saved in that spot and will still appear after the page is reloaded.
